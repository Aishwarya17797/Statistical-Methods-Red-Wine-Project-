# Statistical-Methods-Red-Wine-Project-

This project investigates the factors influencing the quality of red wine using a sample dataset of 10,000 wines. Statistical techniques are employed to analyze the data and derive valuable insights.

**Analysis Techniques:**

**Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizes the key characteristics of the wine quality data, such as central tendency, spread, and distribution.                                    
**Hypothesis Testing**: Formulates and tests hypotheses about the relationships between wine attributes and quality.
**Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: Provides foundation for statistical inferences based on sample data.
**Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: Estimates model parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing the data.

**Expected Outcomes:**

Identify significant relationships between wine attributes and quality.
Gain insights into the factors that contribute to higher quality wines.
Develop a foundation for further exploration and predictive modeling.

**Data:**

The analysis is based on a sample dataset of 10,000 red wines, containing attributes such as:
Chemical properties (e.g., alcohol content, pH)
Physical properties (e.g., color intensity)
Sensory characteristics

**Disclaimer:**
This project uses a sample dataset and may not be representative of the entire population of red wines.

**Future Work:**

Expand the analysis to include a larger and more comprehensive dataset.
Explore advanced statistical modeling techniques, such as regression analysis.
Develop a model to predict wine quality based on its attributes.
