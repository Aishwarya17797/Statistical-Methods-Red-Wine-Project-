### Red Wine Dataset

This report summarizes our findings, offering insights into the chemical composition and sensory evaluations of red wines to unveil factors contributing to wine quality bringing together the art of wine tasting and data analysis.

```{r}
#Importing the necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

```

***Importing Dataset***

```{r include=TRUE}

#Reading the data set
file_path_red <- here("Data", "winequality-red.csv")
red_wine_data <- read.table(file_path_red, sep = ";", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
view(red_wine_data)
attach(red_wine_data)

```

***Snapshot of the Dataset***

The dataset had seperation value as ';' instead of ',' as in any regular csv file. So, while reading the file we specified the seperation value of ';' to read variables in seperate columns.
